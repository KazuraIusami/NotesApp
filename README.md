# NotesApp
I made a simple notes app with html and js

Just download the source code, extract, and open the html

There is a simple username element (once you enter the name and press submit, thats it, its set unless you clear the localStorage in console)

Simple notes area with input

Also a background color changer

Everything gets set in local storage so you don't have to set it every time
